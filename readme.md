# ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Crashcart ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

![A crash cart from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Crash_Cart.jpg)

Crashcart is an in progress suite of tools used to diagnose and treat various problems that a server might encounter during its lifetime, particularly in times of crisis. Crashcart combines an interactive notebooks built on top of rerun.io with a SQL to BPF compiler in order to let system administrators of all stripes quickly and confidently deal with a wide variety of issues that might affect a system. 

Work in progress. 

# Quickstart 

To install crashcart, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zmaril/crashcart
cd crashcart
cargo install rerun-cli
cargo install --path .
crashcart
```

For now to update crashcart, run the following commands: 
```bash
cd crashcart
git pull
cargo install --path .
```

# Motivation 

I never really got AWK, and so bpftrace never really clicked with me. Likewise, using bpf directly is hard and it never became the tool I reach for first. About ten years ago, I thought about compiling SQL to BPF, but it seemed really difficult to do. I still haven't done it yet, but the tools have advanced enough now that I think it feels possible in the next few weeks with some work. 

# Architecture 


### UI 

Constraints: good graphing and visualization, easy to use, easy to install, easy to share, access to the underlying system so it can use containers and ssh with KnownHosts.

Considered 

Trying: 


### SQL-to-BPF


### Interchange 


SQL-to-BPF 

Rust 
rerun.io
openssh and knownhosts 




Uses rust
Clang
Compiles bpf programs in clang in container on your computer, then ssh's them over. 

Hand written lexer and parser for SQL, because I like doing that, plus writing a custom one based off sqlparser-rs seems hard. 


# Zack's todo list  
* Set up rerun 
* Figure out how to get clang to run the right way on mac. 
* Use colima and docker in order to build stuff
